# Custom Domain Setup for Embecta Web App

## Overview
Your Embecta web application is currently live at:
**https://witty-forest-015fdda0f.1.azurestaticapps.net**

To make it accessible via your own custom domain (e.g., `embecta.yourdomain.com`), please follow the steps below.

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Subdomain

Decide what subdomain you'd like to use. Common options include:
- `embecta.yourdomain.com`
- `training.yourdomain.com`
- `learn.yourdomain.com`
- Or any other subdomain of your choice

**Please confirm with us what subdomain name you'd like to use.**

---

## Step 2: Access Your DNS Management

You'll need access to your domain's DNS management panel. This is typically found through:
- Your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
- Your hosting provider
- Your IT department (if managed internally)

If you're unsure where your DNS is managed, contact your domain registrar or IT support.

---

## Step 3: Create a CNAME Record

Once you have access to your DNS management panel, create a new **CNAME record** with the following details:

### DNS Record Details:

| Record Type | Name/Host | Value/Target | TTL |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| CNAME | `[your-chosen-subdomain]` | `witty-forest-015fdda0f.1.azurestaticapps.net` | 3600 (or default) |

### Example:
If you chose `embecta.yourdomain.com`:

- **Type:** CNAME
- **Name:** `embecta`
- **Value:** `witty-forest-015fdda0f.1.azurestaticapps.net`
- **TTL:** 3600 seconds (or leave as default)

### Important Notes:
- Some DNS providers use `Name` or `Host`, while others use `Alias` for the subdomain field
- Some DNS providers automatically append your domain name, so you may only need to enter the subdomain part (e.g., just `embecta` instead of `embecta.yourdomain.com`)
- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate, though they often complete within 15-30 minutes

---

## Step 4: Save and Confirm

After creating the CNAME record:

1. **Save** your DNS changes
2. **Notify us** with the exact subdomain you configured (e.g., `embecta.yourdomain.com`)
3. We will then add your custom domain to the Azure Static Web App and enable HTTPS

---

## Step 5: Wait for Propagation

Once we've added your custom domain on our end:
- DNS propagation typically takes **15-30 minutes** but can take up to **48 hours**
- Azure will automatically provision a free SSL certificate for HTTPS
- SSL certificate provisioning takes **3-5 minutes** after DNS propagation

---

## Verification

To verify your DNS record is configured correctly, you or we can run:

```bash
nslookup embecta.yourdomain.com
```

It should return the Azure Static Web App hostname: `witty-forest-015fdda0f.1.azurestaticapps.net`
